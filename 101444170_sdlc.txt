DevOps plays a crucial role in modern software development by bridging the gap between development and operations teams.
 In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), DevOps ensures a seamless flow from code development to deployment and 
 maintenance, enhancing productivity and reducing the risk of errors. By automating processes such as testing, integration, 
 and deployment, DevOps practices help in delivering high-quality software faster and more reliably. Furthermore, 
 learning DevOps equips developers with skills in CI/CD, automation, and cloud technologies, which are essential for
  building scalable, secure, and efficient software systems in today's fast-paced tech environment.
