The course DevOps, with the course code COMP3104, is about a DevOps engineer's methods, 
conventions, and prime implementations. This course dives into the processes developer 
operators would use in the workplace, permitting students to gain experience through 
the hands-on lab exercises following the primary obligations of DevOps. For example, 
I learned that GitHub is used for version control and understood how the SDLC is 
effective with DevOps fundamentals. Knowing how to use GitHub is important for 
developers' collaboration.
