COMP 3104 â€“ DevOps is a core course offered in the Computer Programming and Analysis program at George Brown College.
 This course introduces students to the principles and practices of DevOps, a modern approach to software development
  that integrates development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, efficiency, and delivery times.
   The curriculum covers key concepts such as version control with Git, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD),
    automation, and cloud computing. Students also engage in hands-on projects using tools like GitHub, Jenkins, Docker,
     and Kubernetes, learning to create automated pipelines and deploy applications in cloud environments.
