Learning DevOps in the software development life cycle enables quicker and 
more efficient software delivery. Planning is where developers work with stakeholders 
to create a proper project plan, allowing the developers to move on to write the 
code based on the requirements and specifications determined. Having DevOps teams 
do version control with software like GitHub throughout allows best practices code 
with the quality maintained. Through the building process, DevOps teams use CI/CDs 
to have builds that can be reproduced. They go through the software development life 
cycle using software that enables them to create a well-put-together product that is 
easy to maintain and use.
