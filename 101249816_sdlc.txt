  - Collaboration: It fosters better communication and collaboration between teams.
  - Quality: Automated testing and monitoring improve software quality and reduce bugs.
  - Scalability: Makes it easier to scale applications and infrastructures.
  - Customer satisfaction: Faster, more reliable releases mean happier customers.
